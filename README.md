# Usage if running bot from code:
Run pip install -r requirements.txt
If you want to train the models, run pip intall -r training_requirements.txt
Create a .env file
Invite the bot to the server
Run python main.py

# To add bot to server:
i will do this later

# How to use this bot:
Call !cloud to identify clouds

# Datasets I used to train 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mmichelli/cirrus-cumulus-stratus-nimbus-ccsn-database

I do not have these in the github because otherwise that would be too much storage. However, I have stored them in a folder in this directory called "data" under "clouds".

# Other notes:
Data and models that are not the final model might not be on github, as those are big and eat storage.
