# IMPORTANT TO
fix it when ppl crop it weird

# Testing checklist
- Identify clouds w/ things that are not images or weirdly cropped images
- !cloudinfo gives images
- all 11 cloud infos
- help command

# nice to have
I wanna do some image segmentation stuf too
add a !plant command (this forces download of stuff, so might be annoying)
pick out the better images from all the dirs (maybe 10/dir?)
